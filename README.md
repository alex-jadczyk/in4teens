It is very similar to the other page I created (maticolor) but made using Flexbox instead of floats. Both are obsolete and CSS Grid should be used instead because it is now well supported by browsers. I used those here to revise and because still most of the companies are using them. 

There are few other things worth mentioning about both projects:
1. I used viewports instead of pixels in many cases. They scale quite well on different devices. I may have abused them in some parts of the code though (in some parts of the code rem should be used, sizes should be more interconnected too.
2. I tried to make use of comments and not to bloat the code. In CSS, I tried to put global styles first and make use of BEM methodology (although this is the thing I still need to work on).
3. Although there are many ways to reset the style, I used normalize.css.  
4. Of course I made them mobile-first and added media queries for better look and feel on different devices. Progressive enhancement is a standard.
5. I could have used a preprocessor although it was probably not that much necessary for such small projects.
