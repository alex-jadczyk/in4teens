    <h2>So you do not want to waste time...</h2>
    <p>You attend some IT lessons at school. You probably learnt about computers and how to fix them. Maybe you had an assignment to build your first website from scratch in HTML and CSS or created a blog on Wordpress. Probably you worked in some graphical programmes like Gimp and made something using Scratch (Logo or Python, if you are soon finishing middle school).</p>
    <p>That is great! All thanks to schools for teaching all these. And to you for your big efford and will to learn. Although these were just sized chunks to make you familiar with many IT topics, it is a very strong starting point. We were thinking that you may like to know somebody actually doing these things on daily basis so that you can get some pro tips, work insigns and inspiration.</p>
